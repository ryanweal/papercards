> The render utility will need a webserver, which we recommend points to the
"dist" folder insider this package which is generated by running `npm run
generate`, or using yarn as the Nuxt developers (see below) do...

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
